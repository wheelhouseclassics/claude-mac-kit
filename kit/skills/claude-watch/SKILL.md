# claude-watch — see the video, not just the transcript

Claude has no native video model, so this skill splits a video into images + text and reads both with
timestamps aligned. Run every step; never skip the dense-hook sampling.

All commands are for the Bash tool. `yt-dlp`, `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` and whisper.cpp (`whisper-cli`) are
Homebrew installs on PATH (`/opt/homebrew/bin`): `brew install yt-dlp ffmpeg whisper-cpp`. Whisper models
live in `~/.claude/models`.

## Step 1 — Download the video
```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/claude-watch && cd /tmp/claude-watch
yt-dlp -o video.mp4 -f "mp4" "<URL>"
ffprobe -v error -show_entries format=duration -of csv=p=0 video.mp4   # duration (seconds)
```

## Step 2 — Two-stage frame sampling (the important part)
The hook holds the most motion and decides retention — sample it densely; sample the body sparsely.
```bash
# HOOK: first 15s at 15 fps → tiled contact sheets (5 cols x 9 rows = 45 frames = 3s per sheet)
mkdir -p hook && ffmpeg -y -t 15 -i video.mp4 \
  -vf "fps=15,scale=200:-1,tile=5x9:margin=6:padding=4:color=white" -an hook/sheet_%02d.jpg
# BODY: 1 frame / 3.5s across the whole video
mkdir -p body && ffmpeg -y -i video.mp4 -vf "fps=1/3.5,scale=360:-1" body/f_%02d.jpg
```
Read the sheets in order; frame N in the hook is at t = N / 15 seconds (sheet k, cell i → frame (k-1)*45 + i).

## Step 3 — Transcribe the audio (free, local)
```bash
ffmpeg -y -i video.mp4 -ar 16000 -ac 1 audio.wav
whisper-cli -m ~/.claude/models/ggml-base.en.bin -f audio.wav -otxt -of transcript
```
If the model file is missing, fetch it once:
`mkdir -p ~/.claude/models && curl -L -o ~/.claude/models/ggml-base.en.bin https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-base.en.bin`.
If YouTube has captions, use those (free, exact). Always sanity-check the transcript against the frames —
local models mishear names (they'll hear "Claude" as "plot").

## Step 4 — Read frames + transcript together, then output
Look at the hook sheets and body frames, line them up with the transcript timestamps, and produce:
1. **Transcript** (corrected against what's on screen).
2. **Scene-by-scene breakdown** — for each chapter: time, what's on screen, the on-screen text, the cut.
3. **Why it works** — 2–3 concrete mechanisms (hook structure, cut cadence, the one visual payoff, the CTA).
4. **Steal-the-structure notes** — what to lift into your own video (change the content, keep the structure).

Clean up `/tmp/claude-watch` when done.
